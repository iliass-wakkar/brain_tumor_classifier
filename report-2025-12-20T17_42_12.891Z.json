We developed CRISPR-based RNA-fusion transcript detection assays using SHERLOCK (Specific High-sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter unLOCKing) for the diagnosis of fusion-driven leukemias. We validated these assays using diagnostic APL and CML patient samples from academic centers and dried blood spots from low-resource environments, demonstrating 100% sensitivity and specificity. We identified assay optimizations to enable the use of these tests outside of tertiary cancer centers and clinical laboratories, enhancing the potential impact of this technology. Rapid point-of-care diagnostics can improve outcomes in cancer patients by expanding access to therapies for highly treatable diseases that would otherwise lead to serious adverse outcomes due to delayed or missed diagnoses.","pdfHash":"","sectionTitle":"abstract","isBody":false,"sentenceOffsets":[],"refMentions":[]}]},{"id":"(Kumar et al., 2024)","corpusId":273548493,"snippets":["Cancer detection poses a significant challenge for researchers and clinical experts due to its status as the leading cause of global mortality.

Through the fusion of DenseNet201 with color histogram techniques, a novel hybrid feature set emerges, engineered to elevate classification accuracy. The comprehensive evaluation encompasses eight diverse machine learning (ML) algorithms, spanning from K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to Support Vector Machines (SVM), including notable contenders such as LightGBM (LGBM), CatBoost, XGBoost, decision trees (DT), random forests (RF), and multinomial naive Bayes (MultinomialNB). This rigorous examination illuminates a distinguished model, achieving a remarkable accuracy rate of 99.683% on the LC25000 dataset. The extension of this methodology to breast cancer detection, utilizing the BreakHis dataset, yields a commendable accuracy rate of 94.808%.

Tools that provide personalized future cancer risk assessment could focus approaches toward those most likely to benefit. We hypothesized that a deep learning model assessing the entire volumetric LDCT data could be built to predict individual risk without requiring additional demographic or clinical data. METHODS We developed a model called Sybil using LDCTs from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST). Sybil requires only one LDCT and does not require clinical data or radiologist annotations; it can run in real time in the background on a radiology reading station. Sybil was validated on three independent data sets: a heldout set of 6,282 LDCTs from NLST participants, 8,821 LDCTs from Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), and 12,280 LDCTs from Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (CGMH, which included people with a range of smoking history including nonsmokers). RESULTS Sybil achieved area under the receiver-operator curves for lung cancer prediction at 1 year of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.88 to 0.95) on NLST, 0.86 (95% CI, 0.82 to 0.90) on MGH, and 0.94 (95% CI, 0.91 to 1.00) on CGMH external validation sets. Concordance indices over 6 years were 0.75 (95% CI, 0.72 to 0.78), 0.81 (95% CI, 0.77 to 0.85), and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.75 to 0.86) for NLST, MGH, and CGMH, respectively. CONCLUSION Sybil can accurately predict an individual's future lung cancer risk from a single LDCT scan to further enable personalized screening.

METHODS We developed a model called Sybil using LDCTs from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST). Sybil requires only one LDCT and does not require clinical data or radiologist annotations; it can run in real time in the background on a radiology reading station. Sybil was validated on three independent data sets: a heldout set of 6,282 LDCTs from NLST participants, 8,821 LDCTs from Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), and 12,280 LDCTs from Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (CGMH, which included people with a range of smoking history including nonsmokers). RESULTS Sybil achieved area under the receiver-operator curves for lung cancer prediction at 1 year of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.88 to 0.95) on NLST, 0.86 (95% CI, 0.82 to 0.90) on MGH, and 0.94 (95% CI, 0.91 to 1.00) on CGMH external validation sets. Concordance indices over 6 years were 0.75 (95% CI, 0.72 to 0.78), 0.81 (95% CI, 0.77 to 0.85), and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.75 to 0.86) for NLST, MGH, and CGMH, respectively. CONCLUSION Sybil can accurately predict an individual's future lung cancer risk from a single LDCT scan to further enable personalized screening. Future study is required to understand Sybil's clinical applications. Our model and annotations are publicly available.","pdfHash":"","sectionTitle":"abstract","isBody":false,"sentenceOffsets":[],"refMentions":[]}]},{"id":"(Vedula et al., 2024)","corpusId":271063834,"snippets":["Fusion oncogenes can be cancer-defining molecular alterations that are essential for diagnosis and therapy selection.1,2 Rapid and accessible molecular diagnostics for fusion-driven leukemias such as acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) are unavailable, creating a barrier to timely diagnosis and effective targeted therapy in many healthcare settings, including community hospitals and low-resource environments.
